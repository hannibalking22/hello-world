# hello-world
Just want to say hi to everyone 
My name is Antonio I'm trying to teach my self to code so far im still learning the basics and taking my time with it, that's what I have seen many established developers tell everone who is interested in the field. That's what i will do try and get familiar and comfortable with everything. Hopefully one day in the near future i can land a good and rewarding job or least have sone fun with code in my spare time.
